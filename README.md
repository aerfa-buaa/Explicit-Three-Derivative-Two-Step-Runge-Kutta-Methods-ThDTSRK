# Explicit-Three-Derivative-Two-Step-Runge-Kutta-Methods-ThDTSRK

This work builds the order accuracy conditions for Three-Derivative Two-Step Runge-Kutta Methods (ThDTSRK). We propose A-stability property theory for ThDTSRK methods, and find optimal stability coefficients. The stability regions of ThDTSRK methods are displayed in file (A-stable-ThDTSRK.nb). The order of convergence for ThDTSRK methods are tested on the Prothero-Robinson problem, the order accuracy are in line with the expectation.
